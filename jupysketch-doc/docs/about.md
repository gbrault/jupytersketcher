In summer 2020 I discovered [Pysketcher](https://github.com/hplgit/pysketcher) as I was looking for a way to create Physics sketches for both design communication and simulation.

My second requirement is to have sketches available in Jupyter notebooks (Lab or notebook server)

This piece of software was developped by [Hans Petter Langtangen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Petter_Langtangen), see it in [GitHub](https://github.com/hplgit/pysketcher), I just need to upgrade it to make it compatible with Jupyter
