# Welcome to Jupyter Sketcher Documentation

## Problem solved

When you need to solve a mechanical problem, sooner or later you are going to sketch a figure to capture the parameters and variables of the problem.

The better documented, the easier the problem is to resolve for the designer, and the easier it is for others to understand how it is actually solved.

What if you could capture this in the program solving the problem and use it as a repository for all definitions and physical variables?

This is what jupytersketcher (name of pysketcher module) is proposing to solve.

Of course, this makes even more sense when using Jupyter notebooks, because as a sketch not only the image of the solved problem can be displayed, but the dictionary of all variables processed in the notebook for solving physics is used to draw the image and at the same time to solve the equations of motion.

jupytersketcher is another small step towards reusable science.

## Getting Started
