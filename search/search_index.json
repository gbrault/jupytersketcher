My second requirement is to have sketches available in Jupyter notebooks (Lab or notebook server) Pysketch was developped in 2012 by Hans Petter Langtangen , see it in GitHub . At that time, Jupyter was emerging and Pysketch was developped as a standalone application.

HPL is showing the hierachical nature of sketches. This is implemented via the Composition function. One can further grasp this using the graphviz_dot function applied to discover the composition herarchy implemented as a graphviz image see The hierarchy of the \"friction\" sketch at the end of this page. Due to the hierarchical nature of sketches, it is quite straightforward to think about using yaml as the syntax for defining a sketch. Benefits are the following: Leaner sketch writing as only data relevant to the context needs to be defined A more straightforward reading for the same reason A more robust sketch definition The same set of rules is applied to generate a sketch No further python idiom is be intermingled as opposed to the case of python defined sketches Don't make me wrong! Data defined versus program defined there is no winner, it's just a matter of context Example This example provides the yaml content to define the Dry Friction case The final sketch An inclined plan (the A-B edge) supports a blue rectangle which is dragged down by gravity. The plan makes an angle \\theta \\theta with the ground level. Sketch implementation notebook includes a controller enabling the \\theta \\theta angle to change. The whole plan, including the body, can rotate arround point B. Support files The example we are developing now is based upon the \"Dry Friction mockup\" notebook the rendered html version of the notbook can be viewed here the notebook can be download here The yaml definition Sketcher language is defined as a yaml compliant file or string. The yaml file is a dictionnary of \"objects\". Objects can be regular python objects or sketcher objects. A skertcher object is composed as follow: a formula : it's a leaf object, like Rectangle, Circle, Line etc or a composition a style list : line or fill colors, line stroke... declared as a yaml hierarchy a transformation list : the defined object can be transformed using sketcher transformation: translation, rotation... As a general rule, a new object suppose all parameters to be defined before they are used to construct it. For example, you can create a circle if the center and the radius have been defined earlier in the file. The general layout of a sketcher file is as follow: Libraries, Construction Variables, Frame declaration of the libraries used by the objects further declared: at least pysketcher is mandatory various global variable which encompass the \"Construction\" variables which define the object main physical dimensions, positions... some \"actions\" corresponding to executable python sentences One mandatory action is the setting of the drawing frame (drawing_tool.set_coordinate_system): it must be declared before any other pysketcher object is used. Other use case of action is the setting of global parameters like default line color: (drawing_tool.set_linecolor('black')) for example this is stored in the head string thereafter The example uses the following objects libraries: setting the libraries used for this sketch constants: all the sketch dimensionning data frame: all the shapes or geometric objects which will be used by the other shapes Sketcher Objects Usually starting with the declaration of Pysketcher leaf objects (Geometry object like Line, Circle, Rectangle...)
