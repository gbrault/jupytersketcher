The better documented, the easier the problem is to resolve for the designer, and the easier it is for others to understand how it is actually solved. What if you could capture this in the program solving the problem and use it as a repository for all definitions and physical variables? This is what jupytersketcher (name of pysketcher module) is proposing to solve. Of course, this makes even more sense when using Jupyter notebooks, because as a sketch not only the image of the solved problem can be displayed, but the dictionary of all variables processed in the notebook for solving physics is used to draw the image and at the same time to solve the equations of motion. jupytersketcher is another small step to help building reusable science.

My second requirement is to have sketches available in Jupyter notebooks (Lab or notebook server) Pysketch was developped in 2012 by Hans Petter Langtangen , see it in GitHub . At that time, Jupyter was emerging and Pysketch was developped as a standalone application. I just need to upgrade it to make it compatible with Jupyter: This is the inception of Jupyter Sketch project! A sketch capturing the \"dry friction case\" How it is structured: the composition hierarchy","title":"About"},{"location":"sketcher/","text":"A language to describe a sketch Pysketcher initial version HPL Pysketcher enable sketch definition in python. HPL is showing the hierachical nature of sketches. This is implemented via the Composition function. One can further grasp this using the graphviz_dot function applied to discover the composition herarchy implemented as a graphviz image see The hierarchy of the \"friction\" main object at the end of this page. Due to the hierarchical nature of sketches, it is quite straightforward to think about using yaml as the syntax for defining a sketch. Benefits are the following: Leaner sketch writing as only data relevant to the context needs to be defined A more straightforward reading for the same reason A more robust sketch definition The same set of rules is applied to generate a sketch No further python idiom is be intermingled as opposed to the case of python defined sketches Of course, data defined versus program defined there is no winner, it's just a matter of context Example This example provides the yaml content to define the Dry Friction case The final sketch An inclined plan (the A-B edge) supports a blue rectangle which is dragged down by gravity. The plan makes an angle \\theta \\theta with the ground level. Sketch implementation notebook includes a controller enabling the \\theta \\theta angle to change. The whole plan, including the body, can rotate arround point B. Support files The example we are developing now is based upon the \"Dry Friction mockup\" notebook the rendered html version of the notbook can be viewed here the notebook can be download here The yaml definition Sketcher language is defined as a yaml compliant file or string. The yaml file is a dictionnary of \"objects\". Objects can be regular python objects or sketcher objects. A skertcher object is composed as follow: a formula : it's a leaf object, like Rectangle, Circle, Line etc or a composition a style list : line or fill colors, line stroke... declared as a yaml hierarchy a transformation list : the defined object can be transformed using sketcher transformation: translation, rotation... As a general rule, a new object suppose all parameters to be defined before they are used to construct it. For example, you can create a circle if the center and the radius have been defined earlier in the file. The general layout of a sketcher file is as follow: Libraries, Construction Variables, Frame declaration of the libraries used by the objects further declared: at least pysketcher is mandatory various global variable which encompass the \"Construction\" variables which define the object main physical dimensions, positions... some \"actions\" corresponding to executable python sentences One mandatory action is the setting of the drawing frame (drawing_tool.set_coordinate_system): it must be declared before any other pysketcher object is used. Other use case of action is the setting of global parameters like default line color: (drawing_tool.set_linecolor('black')) for example this is stored in the head string thereafter Objects Usually starting with the declaration of Pysketcher leaf objects Then aggregated using the composition object Composition can be made of composition object (recursive behaviour) Grouping leafs and composition will be further used to apply transformation latter on (based on the \"physics\") The example presents three group of objects The body object The plan object The friction main object The plan includes the body The friction includes the plan (that will be able to rotate as a group) and the ground (will stay fixed) Libraries, Construction Variables, Frame head = \"\"\"\\ libraries: [\"from math import tan, radians, sin, cos\",\"from pysketcher import *\"] fontsize: 18 g: 9.81 # constant gravity theta: 30.0 # inclined plane angle L: 10.0 # sketch sizing parameter a: 1.0 # xmin: 0.0 # sketech min Abscissa ymin: -3.0 # sketech min Ordinate rl: 2.0 # rectangle width rL: 1.0 # rectangle length setframe: # sketch setup action: \"drawing_tool.set_coordinate_system(xmin=xmin-L/5, xmax=xmin+1.5*L,ymin=ymin, ymax=ymin+1.5*L,instruction_file='tmp_mpl_friction.py')\" setblackline: # default frame values and actions action: \"drawing_tool.set_linecolor('black')\" B: point(a+L,0) # wall right end A: point(a,tan(radians(theta))*L) # wall left end normal_vec: point(sin(radians(theta)),cos(radians(theta))) # Vector normal to wall tangent_vec: point(cos(radians(theta)),-sin(radians(theta))) # Vector tangent to wall help_line: Line(A,B) # wall line x: a + 3*L/10. y: help_line(x=x) contact: point(x, y) c: contact + rL/2*normal_vec \"\"\" The body object body=\"\"\"\\ rectangle: formula: Rectangle(contact, rl, rL) style: linecolor: blue filled_curves: blue transform: [\"rotate(-theta, contact)\", \"translate(-rl/2*tangent_vec)\"] N: formula: Force(contact - rl*normal_vec, contact, r'$N$', text_pos='start') style: linecolor: black wheel: formula: \"Composition({'outer': rectangle})\" style: shadow: 1 mc: formula: Text(r'$c$', c) body: formula: \"Composition({'wheel': wheel, 'N': N, 'mc': mc})\" style: linecolor: black \"\"\" The plan object plan=\"\"\"\\ mB: formula: Text(r'$B$',B) mA: formula: Text(r'$A$', A) wall: formula: Wall(x=[A[0], B[0]], y=[A[1], B[1]], thickness=-0.25,transparent=False) style: linecolor: black x_const: formula: Line(contact, contact + point(0,4)) style: linestyle: dotted transform: rotate(-theta, contact) x_axis: formula: \"Axis(start=contact+ 2*rl*normal_vec, length=2*rl,label='$x$', rotation_angle=-theta)\" plan: formula: \"Composition({'body': body, 'inclined wall': wall, 'x start': x_const, 'x axis': x_axis, 'mA': mA, 'mB': mB})\" \"\"\" The friction sketch friction=\"\"\"\\ mg: formula: Gravity(c, rl, text='$Mg$') style: linecolor: black angle: formula: \"Arc_wText(r'$<bslash>theta$', center=B, radius=3, start_angle=180-theta, arc_angle=theta, fontsize=fontsize)\" style: linecolor: black linewidth: 1 ground: formula: Line((B[0]-L/10., 0), (B[0]-L/2.,0)) stlye: linecolor: black linestyle: dashed linewidth: 1 friction: formula: \"Composition({'plan': plan, 'ground': ground, 'mg': mg, 'angle': angle})\" \"\"\" Using the parser To parse the above example, the following code do the job. 1. the head must be used first as all the other bits needs one or more variable it defines. 2.
